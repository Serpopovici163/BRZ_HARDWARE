Schematic notes:
TODO: 
optimize 5V regulator schematic as per datasheet
get different OP-amp IC? Currently have 3x4ch for 10ch so 2ch unused
Flip CAN shield pinout on PCB so it can be soldered on opposite side? This breaks ground plane so could be an issue


MOSFET_V2 includes redundant MOSFETs with summed DIAG output (5V assuming V_BATT = 12V)
--> One MOSFET outputs 4V and the other 1V (12V/Rx where x is the resistor corresponding to MOSFET in question)
--> Circuitry based on summing op-amp from Wikipedia

MOSFETs_V2 includes an array of MOSFET_V2 sheets with op amps to generate an analog output based on DIAG output
--> output of op-amp component is 3.3V assuming V_BATT = 12V to accomodate for higher than normal voltages 

Channel list:

MOSFET Channels (10):
RL brake
RL indicator
RR brake
RR indicator
Rear running lights
Rear license plate (separate from running lights? - nyet)
FL C-light
FR C-light
FL indicator
FR indicator

Addressable Channels (5 but gonna include 8):

Front bumper (includes wheel well indicator strobes and lower bumper strobes) (4)
Headlight channel (both headlight strobes) (2)
Rear bumper (4th brake light) (includes three leds: left, brake, and right) (3)
Internal channel (includes rear quarter pannel strobes and third brake light and potentially license plate strobes?) (3 or 5 with LP strobes)
Underlighting (one channel for whole set) (strip)
